### APP

#### adapter provides an adapter from fedora into elasticsearch.
./app/adapters/application.js:9:  elasticsearchURI = ENV.fedora.elasticsearch;

#### Routes helps store the results returned from ES.
./app/routes/dashboard.js:22:    let approvalResults = await this.ajax.post(ENV.fedora.elasticsearch, {
./app/routes/dashboard.js:38:    let editsResults = await this.ajax.post(ENV.fedora.elasticsearch, {

#### Services have a bunch of different kinds of services like autocomplete, search-helper, etc.

1. Search Helper: service to help other components that rely on ES.
./app/services/search-helper.js:6: * This service can be referenced by components that rely on Elasticsearch query results
./app/services/search-helper.js:74:   * Wait for Elasticsearch to be reindexed with the given value.

2. Autocomplete: provides autocomplete feature during search on UI.
./app/services/autocomplete.js:6: * Service designed to hit the Elasticsearch autocomplete service to get suggestions
./app/services/autocomplete.js:23:    return ENV.fedora.elasticsearch;
./app/services/autocomplete.js:112:   * Adapt Elasticsearch results to a flat array.
./app/services/autocomplete.js:115:   * 'response.suggest' is where Elasticsearch sticks the autocomplete suggestions.
./app/services/autocomplete.js:122:   * @param {object} response response from Elasticsearch
